<p>Allow me to extend a firm virtual handshake! I'm a BI Analyst @ Goldman Sachs. I graduated from University of Cincinnati with a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics.

**ANALYTICS, INSIGHTS, IMPACTS**

My passion lies in deciphering data's hidden stories and leveraging analytics to drive insights and innovation. I don't just support my organization, I help it discovers what's next. 📊💡
