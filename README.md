April 2023: Having already had extensive exposure to Tableau, I decided to tackle the Maven Analytics Family Leave challenge in Power BI and gain my first hands-on experience with the tool outside of Udemy. This dashboard analyzes paid parental leave policies across 1,600+ companies and 46 industries, highlighting disparities between maternity and paternity leave

June 2023: Afterwards, I participated in another Analytics Challenge where I built a KPI dashboard to help a shipping company track critical performance metrics.

July 2023: After completing a summer internship across two teams, I continued as a part-time intern on the Procter & Gamble Grooming team, where I spearheaded the harmonization of multiple data sources into a single Power BI report with **25** pages while working on Power BI initiatives for two more teams. As the sole data analyst working alongside a data engineer and a data scientist, I made a significant impact—my mentor noted that they had “never seen an intern steer the direction of an entire team like this and even got visibility from the grooming CEO"

Hey Peter,
It has been an absolute blast working with you the past few months. I have seen major improvement in both your technical and soft skills, and greatly appreciate your efforts to continuously get better. I know it takes some trust to follow our lead on strange, open-ended projects, so thank you for trusting in us. Thank you in addition for always being willing to try a new task, whether or notyou are familiar with it. I was very impressed that you were willing to work on UiPath with no prior experience.
You bring a fun, enthusiastic energy to the team that will be missed – please stay in touch!
