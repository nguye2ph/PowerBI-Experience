April 2023: Having already had extensive exposure to Tableau, I decided to tackle the Maven Analytics Family Leave challenge in Power BI and gain my first hands-on experience with the tool outside of Udemy. This dashboard analyzes paid parental leave policies across 1,600+ companies and 46 industries, highlighting disparities between maternity and paternity leave

July 2023: After completing a summer internship across two teams, I continued as a part-time intern on the Procter & Gamble Grooming team, where I spearheaded the harmonization of multiple data sources into a single Power BI report. As the sole data analyst working alongside a data engineer and a data scientist, I made a significant impact—my mentor noted that they had “never seen an intern steer the direction of an entire team like this and even got visibility from the grooming CEO" 
  
April 2024: While interning at Fifth Third Bank, I studied and passed the certification for the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Certification.
