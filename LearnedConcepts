## Quick reference & shortcuts
- Undo in Power BI: use the undo button (or Ctrl+Z where supported).
- Search inside a slicer: click the ellipsis on the slicer or press Ctrl+F (doesn’t work for numeric slicers).
- Use Ctrl while multi-selecting points in visuals (e.g., Ctrl + click to select multiple items).
- To remove multiple selections from a visual, use Cut after multi-selecting (or Ctrl+Shift to speed deletions).
- Bring forward: moves an item one step forward; Bring to front: brings it all the way to front.
- Format Painter: copies visual formatting between visuals.
- Lock aspect ratio: keep consistent sizes when resizing visuals.

---

## Data sources & loading
- CSV:
  - Excel comma-separated values: csv — load into Power BI and Tableau.
  - If you must add many CSVs manually, consider automation: use folder queries or parameterized queries to combine files.
- DirectQuery: use when you want to load the data from connections without importing.
- Template (.pbit): Power BI templates can save report structure and queries; you can replace connections in a template to reuse layouts.
- Only work/organization email addresses can share Power BI reports via Office 365 (E3/E5 trial availability).
- Copy charts between reports: paste visuals into the target report if the underlying fields exist and are named consistently.

---

## Power Query / Transformations
- Transform vs Add Column:
  - Transform acts on the existing column (overwrites).
  - Add Column creates a new column and keeps the original.
- Detect data type: Power Query can auto-detect, but verify (especially for timestamps with many times in same date).
- Unpivot/Pivot:
  - Unpivot to go from wide to long (similar to pivot_longer in R).
  - Resources: https://radacad.com/pivot-and-unpivot-with-power-bi
- Merge vs Append:
  - Merge: horizontal join (adds columns) — check join kind.
  - Append: vertical union (adds rows) — column names usually match.
- Merge as new or merge in-place: both options available.
- Keep / Remove rows after sorting: right-click options available.
- Filtering in Power Query is persistent — recorded as steps; not the same as visual/report filtering.
- Creating parameters: useful to duplicate queries or manage dynamic sources.
- Creating query folders and unhiding hidden tables: right-click in Queries pane.
- Binary image to PBI image converter (example function):

let
     BinaryToPbiImage = (BinaryContent as binary) as text =>
     let
         Base64 = "data:image/jpeg;base64," & Binary.ToText(BinaryContent, BinaryEncoding.Base64)
     in
         Base64
in
     BinaryToPbiImage

## Modeling & relationships
- Drag from one table to another to create relationships.
- Relationships view: review and edit relationships in Model view.
- Default summarization: set default summarization for columns in the Column tools.
- Measures vs Columns:
  - Column: stored per row, accessible in every row.
  - Measure: aggregation evaluated in context; returns totals or aggregated values.
- Formatting:
  - If you format dates/numbers in Column Tools, those defaults are used across visuals.
  - To preserve conditional formatting while changing base fields: duplicate the field first then change the base.
- Hierarchies: create by right-clicking a field and choosing New hierarchy or by adding levels; use Drill Up/Drill Down arrows to navigate.

---

## Visualizations & formatting
- Visual types: combo charts, area vs stacked area, 100% stacked column vs stacked column (different behaviors).
- Visual header tooltips: show metadata / instructions — useful to improve UX.
- Visual tooltip pages: create a report page and set it as a tooltip for a visual.
- Visual interactions (Format → Edit interactions): decide whether visuals highlight, filter or do nothing for a given visual.
  - If not enough vertical space, interaction icons may not show.
- Layer order & tab order:
  - Layer order affects visual stacking.
  - Tab order affects keyboard navigation.
- Responsive visuals: can change label size behavior when responsive is enabled.
- Label density setting and Max area width affect data label rendering.
- Data labels:
  - Stacked area charts place labels inside; area charts may allow outside labels.
- Plot area background vs Page background: visuals have their own background and there is a general page background (both behave differently).
- Format without legend:
  - Many visuals allow hiding legend and formatting accordingly.
- Conditional formatting:
  - Use Format Painter to copy conditional formatting between visuals (sometimes carries entire settings).
- Bring visuals into Focus mode to enlarge one visual.
- Smart Narrative: automatically generates text describing visuals; can be for whole page or right-click a visual to describe that visual only.

---

## Slicers, filters & interactions
- Search slicer: turn on search in slicer options (not for numeric).
- Sync slicers: use View → Sync slicers to propagate selections across pages.
- Apply all slicers button: useful UX pattern — only applies slicers when clicked.
- Filter pane: Click the top filter icon to show/hide the filter pane.
- Use edit interactions to change whether visuals highlight, filter, or do nothing (default is highlight).
- To remove or disable the interaction icons, leave Edit interactions mode.
- Drillthrough requires the drillthrough field to be added to the target page.

---

## Drill, Drillthrough & Hierarchies
- Drill Down: drills to a specific element and stays drilled unless toggled again.
- Drill Up: ascend the hierarchy.
- Show next level / Expand next level: the single-level drill vs expand-all behavior.
- Drillthrough: right-click a value to navigate to another page; ensure the field is added in the Drillthrough filters on the target page.

---

## Tooling, preview features & settings
- Preview features: enable in File → Options and settings → Options → Preview features (e.g., On-object interaction).
- On-object interaction: enables clicking chart elements to navigate — turn on via Preview Features.
- Collapsing ribbons and UI customization: collapse the ribbon to increase canvas space.
- Blue tick marks indicate certified visuals.
- Visuals: some features (like anomaly detection) only work on specific visual types and with certain conditions (e.g., anomaly detection works only on line charts with a single line).

---

## Exporting, embedding & sharing
- Export to PowerPoint: use Share → Export to PowerPoint (watch for filter pane / hidden panels affecting layout).
- Embedding:
  - Use publish/embedding options or embed inside SharePoint, websites, or Power BI service.
  - Embedding PDFs: search for approaches (web embed or custom visuals).
- Power BI template (.pbit): use to replicate report structure; to replace connections, open template and point to new data source.
- Export data from visuals: right-click → Export data. Options include exporting as CSV or Excel.
- Only organizational accounts can share via Power BI service (Office 365).

---

## Performance & troubleshooting
- Optimize workbook speed: use Performance Analyzer and consider using separate tasks to multi-task.
- Load more in visuals/tables: use “Load more” buttons to ensure all rows or results are visible.
- If visual resizing doesn't increase height, leave some space below the visual first.
- If colors or parameter settings disappear after renaming data source, re-apply saved color parameters or theme file.

---

## DAX & calculation notes
- Comment syntax in DAX: use double hyphen `--` for comments.
- Quick measures: built-in quick measures can help speed up common calculations.
- Formatting measures to percent: use Format in Modeling or measure formatting options.
- Difference between new columns and measures: columns evaluate row-by-row; measures evaluate in filter/context.

---

## UX / Design / Presentation tips
- Themes & custom themes:
  - Switch themes from the gallery.
  - Create a JSON theme file and Browse for themes (hex color values).
  - Use an external hex picker (e.g., [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en)) to select colors and convert to hex.
- Background images & visual transparency:
  - Add background images and adjust transparency in Format → Background.
- Page size & vertical page navigator:
  - Adjust page size for navigation layout and create vertical page navigator via grid layout settings.
- Bookmarks:
  - Use bookmarks to show/hide buttons or content (dynamic zone visibility), but they can be hard to maintain at scale.
- Use consistent fonts (e.g., Calibri) when copying text from Tableau to Power BI to avoid font fallback issues.

---

## Visuals & analytics features
- Forecasting, Clustering, Anomaly Detection:
  - Forecast: available on certain visuals.
  - Clustering: group similar data points; available in analytics pane.
  - Anomaly detection: line charts only and typically for single-line visuals.
- Error bars: use analytics pane (if visual supports it).
- Grouping & binning: create new groups and bins for continuous variables.

---

## Miscellany / Notes
- Some visual features require categorical vs continuous axis type (change axis type to continuous when necessary).
- Max area width affects labels; label density setting can be tuned.
- Cards: simple card vs card with lightning (different styles).
- Shape map, custom visuals, and marketplace visuals: use prebuilt visuals for specialized requirements.
- R scripts: you can write R scripts inside Power BI; you suggested using ChatGPT to help convert R scripts into DAX — a reasonable prompt engineering approach.

## Final notes
- Automate CSV ingestion: use folder queries, parameters, or Power Automate to avoid manual CSV addition.
- Document learnings in the Maven Dashboard (your personal TODO).
- Consider creating a reproducible template or PBIT for live datasets to streamline replicating visuals across reports.
